# K-Means University Clustering 🚀

This repository focuses on clustering universities into **Private** and **Public** categories using **K-Means Clustering**. It includes a comprehensive Jupyter notebook that covers:

📊 **Data Exploration**: Analyzing and preprocessing university data for effective clustering.  

📍 **K-Means Implementation**: Applying the K-Means algorithm to form distinct university clusters.  

🔧 **Cluster Evaluation**: Assessing clustering results using confusion matrices and classification reports.  

📉 **Visualization**: Plotting clusters, feature distributions, and decision boundaries for better insights.  

This project is ideal for learning **unsupervised learning techniques**, understanding clustering behavior, and applying **K-Means** to real-world educational data.
